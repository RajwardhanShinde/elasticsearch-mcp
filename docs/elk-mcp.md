# Architecture Decision Record (ADR): Building an Elastic Search MCP npm Package for Model Integration with ELK

## Title
Build Elastic Search MCP npm Package for Model Integration with ELK

## Status
Accepted

## Context
In our organization, multiple machine learning models and Node.js applications require robust capabilities for storing, searching, and analyzing large datasets. We have selected the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) as our primary solution, with Elasticsearch serving as the search and analytics engine due to its scalability, performance, and rich feature set. However, integrating each model or application with Elasticsearch individually presents several challenges:

- **Code Duplication**: Each model or application needs to implement its own logic for connecting to Elasticsearch, handling authentication, and performing operations like searching or inserting data. This leads to redundant code and potential inconsistencies across projects.
- **Authentication Complexity**: When deploying on Elastic Cloud, authentication requires the use of a cloud ID and API key, which adds complexity that must be managed consistently to ensure secure and reliable connections.
- **Operational Overhead**: Managing connections, error handling, and updates to Elasticsearch configurations across multiple models or applications is time-consuming and prone to errors.

To address these challenges, we need a standardized, reusable solution that simplifies integration with the ELK stack. By developing a dedicated npm package, we can centralize the logic for interacting with Elasticsearch, streamline development processes, and ensure consistency across all integrations.

## Decision
We will develop an npm package named **"elasticsearch-mcp"** (Elasticsearch Model Context Protocol) to provide a set of tools for Node.js applications to interact seamlessly with the ELK stack. The package will leverage the `@elastic/elasticsearch` client to handle connections to Elasticsearch, specifically supporting authentication via cloud ID and API key for Elastic Cloud environments.

The package will expose the following tools to facilitate interaction with Elasticsearch:

| **Tool**           | **Description**                                                                 |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `fetchIndices`     | Lists all indices in the Elasticsearch cluster.                                 |
| `search`           | Performs search queries on specified indices with customizable parameters.      |
| `exportToCSV`      | Exports search results or index data to CSV format for reporting or analysis.   |
| `insertData`       | Inserts new documents into specified indices.                                   |
| `deleteDocument`   | Deletes documents from specified indices based on provided criteria.            |
| `updateDocument`   | Updates existing documents in specified indices.                                |
| `createIndex`      | Creates new indices with user-defined mappings and settings.                    |

Additional utility functions, such as bulk operations, index deletion, or custom query builders, will be included as needed to support common Elasticsearch use cases. These tools will abstract low-level details, enabling developers to integrate their models or applications with the ELK stack efficiently.

The package will be designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for the addition of new tools or features as requirements evolve. It will be developed using TypeScript to ensure type safety and improve maintainability, and it will be published on npm for easy installation across projects.

## Consequences
### Positive
- **Reduced Code Duplication**: Centralizing Elasticsearch integration logic in a single package eliminates repetitive code across models and applications, reducing development time and potential errors.
- **Simplified Integration**: Developers can integrate their models with ELK by installing the package and using its tools, without needing to manage low-level Elasticsearch configurations or authentication details.
- **Consistent Authentication Handling**: The package ensures uniform handling of cloud ID and API key authentication, enhancing security and reliability in Elastic Cloud environments.
- **Easier Maintenance**: Updates to Elasticsearch configurations, authentication methods, or client dependencies can be managed in one place, simplifying maintenance across projects.
- **Reusability**: The package can be used by any Node.js application requiring ELK integration, not just machine learning models, broadening its applicability.

### Negative
- **Development and Maintenance Effort**: Building and maintaining the package requires initial development resources and ongoing support to address bugs, updates, or new requirements.
- **Potential Complexity**: If not carefully designed, the package could become overly complex, making it harder to maintain or extend over time.
- **Dependency on @elastic/elasticsearch**: The package relies on the official Elasticsearch client, which may introduce dependencies on its updates, changes, or potential breaking changes in future versions.

Despite these challenges, the benefits of a standardized package outweigh the drawbacks, particularly given the number of models and applications that will benefit from streamlined ELK integration.

## Alternatives Considered
| **Alternative**                          | **Pros**                                                                 | **Cons**                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Use Existing Elasticsearch Clients Directly** | No additional development effort; leverages mature libraries like `@elastic/elasticsearch`. | Leads to code duplication, inconsistent authentication, and increased maintenance overhead. |
| **Write Custom Integration Code for Each Model** | Tailored to specific model needs; full control over implementation.       | High duplication of effort, potential for inconsistencies, and difficult to maintain. |
| **Use a Different Search Technology**     | Alternatives like Apache Solr may offer different features or better fit specific use cases. | Elasticsearch is already chosen for its scalability and team familiarity; switching would require significant effort. |

Given these alternatives, building a dedicated MCP package is the most effective solution, as it balances reusability, maintainability, and ease of integration while leveraging our existing investment in Elasticsearch.

## Further Decisions
- **Implementation Language**: The package will be developed using TypeScript to ensure type safety, improve code maintainability, and enhance the developer experience.
- **Distribution**: The package will be published on npm, making it easily accessible for installation in Node.js projects.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation, including usage examples, API references, and setup guides, will be provided to facilitate adoption by developers.
- **Extensibility**: The package will be designed with modularity in mind, allowing for the addition of new tools or customizations as requirements evolve.
- **Testing**: Unit tests and integration tests will be included to ensure reliability and compatibility with different Elasticsearch versions.
- **Versioning**: Semantic versioning will be used to manage releases and ensure compatibility with dependent projects.

## Example Usage
Below is an example of how the `elasticsearch-mcp` package might be used in a Node.js application:

```javascript
const ElasticMCP = require('elasticsearch-mcp');

// Initialize the MCP with Elastic Cloud credentials
const mcp = new ElasticMCP({
  cloudId: 'your-cloud-id',
  apiKey: 'your-api-key'
});

// Fetch all indices
mcp.fetchIndices().then(indices => {
  console.log('Indices:', indices);
});

// Perform a search
mcp.search('my-index', { query: { match: { field: 'value' } } }).then(results => {
  console.log('Search Results:', results);
});

// Export search results to CSV
mcp.exportToCSV('my-index', { query: { match_all: {} } }, 'output.csv').then(() => {
  console.log('Data exported to output.csv');
});

// Insert a new document
mcp.insertData('my-index', { id: '1', data: { name: 'Example', value: 42 } }).then(() => {
  console.log('Document inserted');
});
```
